Hey there! I'm Orion, a geographer, cartographer, and geospatial analyst. I primarily work with ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, SQL, and Python-based GIS packages. This GitHub serves as my public repository of portfolio projects. Check them out below!

## Projects
| Project | Skills | Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Top Street Types in the United States](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/street-types) | Data Analysis, Data Processing, Web Mapping | Python (GeoPandas, FTP, Selenium), Jupyter Notebook, Looker Studio | Designed a Python-based processing script that identifies street types from full street names in the United States, and calculates their summed lengths and the most common street type by U.S. county. Visualized using BI dashboards. |
| [Polygon Spatial Overlap](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/polygon-spatial-overlap) | Geospatial Data Analysis, Cartography | QGIS, Python (PyQGIS) | Designed a PyQGIS-based processing script that calculates the spatial overlap of two polygon datasets, measured using the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). Used to compare area changes in ZIP Code Tabulation Areas between 2010 and 2020. |
| [Spatial Autocorrelation of Cross-Gender Friending Ratios](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/cgfr-localmoransi) | Geospatial Data Analysis, Web Mapping | ArcGIS Online, Python (GeoPandas, PySAL), Jupyter Notebook | Designed a Python-based processing script that calculates global and local spatial autocorrelation of [cross-gender friending ratios (CGFRs)](https://drew-johnston.com/files/cross_gender_ties/Cross-Gender_Social_Ties_Around_the_World.pdf) using the [Moran's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I) statistic. Used to analyze spatial clustering of CGFRs in Germany at the district level. |
| [Spatiotemporal Analysis of Lyme Disease](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/spatiotemporalanalysis-lymedisease) | Geospatial Data Analysis | ArcMap, SaTScan, Excel, Word, Lucidchart | Designed and implemented a research project analyzing spatiotemporal clustering of Lyme disease in New Jersey counties using the space-time scan statistic method in [SaTScan](https://www.satscan.org/). |
