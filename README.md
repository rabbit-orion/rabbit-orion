Hey there! I'm Orion, a geographer, cartographer, and geospatial analyst. I primarily work with ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, SQL, and Python-based GIS packages. This GitHub serves as my public repository of portfolio projects. Check them out below!

## Projects
| Project | Skills | Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Polygon Spatial Overlap](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/polygon-spatial-overlap) | Geospatial Data Analysis, Cartography | QGIS, Python, PyQGIS | Designed a PyQGIS-based processing script that calculates the spatial overlap of two polygon datasets, measured using the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). Used to compare area changes in ZIP Code Tabulation Areas between 2010 and 2020. |
| [Spatial Autocorrelation of Cross-Gender Friending Ratios](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/cgfr-localmoransi) | Geospatial Data Analysis, Web Mapping | ArcGIS Online, Python, Jupyter Notebook, GeoPandas, PySAL | Designed a Python-based processing script that calculates global and local spatial autocorrelation of [cross-gender friending ratios (CGFRs)](https://drew-johnston.com/files/cross_gender_ties/Cross-Gender_Social_Ties_Around_the_World.pdf) using the [Moran's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I) statistic. Used to analyze spatial clustering of CGFRs in Germany at the district level. |
| [Spatiotemporal Analysis of Lyme Disease](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/spatiotemporalanalysis-lymedisease) | Geospatial Data Analysis | ArcMap, SaTScan, Excel, Word, Lucidchart | Designed and implemented a research project analyzing spatiotemporal clustering of Lyme disease in New Jersey counties using the space-time scan statistic method in [SaTScan](https://www.satscan.org/). |
